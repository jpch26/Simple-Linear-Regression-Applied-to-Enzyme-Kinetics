A R tutorial about how to perform a simple linear regression analysis applied to a enzyme kinetics experiment. It also explore an alternative nonlinear regression approach.   

Note that I did not explain how I simulated the experimental data, but you can see the code on data_simulation.R  

If you have cloned this repository and want to run this analysis from scratch first run erase_all_outputs.R script and then run Main.R script o whichever script you want.  

The image and README_files folders contain images that Iâ€™ve used on this presentation.  

## Problem

You have performed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_kinetics" target="_blank">enzyme kinetics</a> experiment. You are supposing a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22430/" target="_blank">Michaelis-Menten</a> kinetics and your aim is to determine the constants Vmax, Km and some other related.  

![](images/enzyme_experiment.jpg)
The first ten observations in your data would look like this:  

```{r kinetic data, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("data/kinetic_data.csv")
data <- head(data, 10)
data$v <- signif(data$v, 2)
data <- kableExtra::kbl(data, digits = 10, col.names = c("S (M)", "v (M/min)"))
kableExtra::kable_classic_2(data, full_width = FALSE)
```

The substrate units are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"target="_blank">molarity</a> expressed simply as M (mol/L), and the velocity units are molarity over minute since you are measuring the change in the substrate concentration per time unit.  

By the way, you can see that the numbers are expressed as , e.g., 8.0e-6. This is the way that R uses to represent scientific notation, so the previous number can be read as 8.0x10^-6^.

The Michelis-Menten equation describes the reaction velocity as a function of the substrate concentration:  

$$
v = Vmax\frac{[S]}{Km + [S]} \quad \textrm{(1)}
$$

## Solution

A regular approach to obtain Vmax and Km is to convert the Michaelis-Menten equation into a "linear form" like:  

$$
\frac{1}{v} = \frac{Km}{Vmax}\frac{1}{[S]} + \frac{1}{Vmax} \quad \textrm{(2)}
$$

Once you obtained your experimental data the next step is to fit a linear model using data transformations (the velocity and the substrate concentration inverse), then take the model coefficients and perform simple calculations to obtain the constants.  

Let's do this and a nice plot. I also want to show you an alternative approach that not require a linear transformation and, hence, not any data transformations.  

As always, in the first place I need to show you how I have organized my analysis project:  

![](images/files_organization.png)

* The analysis folder contains all my R scripts.  
* The data folder contains the experimental data and all CSV and TXT files products of my analysis scripts.  
* The graph folder contains all the plots results of my analysis scripts.  

These three folders are contained in a main folder that can be named as, e.g., "enzyme_experiment", or you can specified the date of your analysis like "enzime_experiment_4FEB2021".    

### Linear regression  

The R analysis script for this analysis:  

```{r linear regression script, code=readLines("analysis/linear_regression.R"), message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

The next code checks if the necessary packages are already loaded and, if they don't, then loaded them.  

```{r check packages, eval=FALSE}
# Packages 
if (!"ggplot2" %in% .packages()) library(ggplot2)
if (!"dplyr" %in% .packages()) library(dplyr)
```

You can omit the if statement while working on your own.  

Then, I imported the experimental data and performed a data transformation using the `dplyr` function `mutate()`:  

```{r import and tranform the data, eval=FALSE}
# 1 Import data -----------------------------------------------------------

kinetic_data <- read.csv("data/kinetic_data.csv")

# 2 Data transformations ---------------------------------------------------

kinetic_data <- kinetic_data %>% 
  mutate(
    S_i = 1/S,
    v_i = 1/v
    )
```

The transformation was simply the inverse of both the concentration and the velocity reaction. The following table shows you the first ten rows of the previous data.  

```{r transformed data, echo=FALSE}
kin_data_kbl <- kableExtra::kbl(head(kinetic_data, 10), digits = 10)
kableExtra::kable_classic_2(kin_data_kbl, full_width=FALSE)
```

Next, I fit the linear model on the transformed data following the linear relation which I showed you previously (equation 2):  

```{r}
# 3 Fitting linear model -------------------------------------------------

# 3.1 Fit linear model 
model_lm <- lm(v_i ~ S_i, data = kinetic_data)

# 3.2 Model summary
model_sum <- summary(model_lm)

# 3.3 Model summary
capture.output(file = "data/model_summary.txt", model_sum)
```

I made a nice summary using the function `summary()`. You can type `model_sum`to see these results (or look for the "model_summary.txt" file in the data folder):  

```{r model summary}
model_sum
```

In the fourth step, I calculated the Vmax and Km constants, and using the enzyme concentration in the experiment I also calculated the constants kcat and kcat/Km that can be useful in you results discussion. I put all these constants into a data frame and saved it in the data folder as a CSV file ("kinetic_report.csv").  

```{r km and Vmax calculus, eval=FALSE}
# 4 Results report -------------------------------------------------------

# 4.1 Obtain the model coefficients 
model_coeff <- coef(model_lm)

# 4.2 Calculate Vmax
v_max <- unname(model_coeff[1]^-1)

# 4.3 Calculate km 
km <- unname(model_coeff[2] * v_max)

# 4.4 Enzyme concentration
enz = 4.5e-8

# 4.5 Calculate kcat and kcat/km 
kcat <- v_max /enz
kcat_km <- kcat / km

# 4.6 Make a data frame with the results
kin_report <- data.frame(
  Vmax = v_max,
  Km   = signif(km, 2),
  Enz  = enz,
  kcat = signif(kcat, 2),
  kcat_Km = signif(kcat_km, 2) 
)

# 4.7 Kinetic report
write.csv(kin_report, "data/kinetic_report.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

The results are these:  

```{r kinetic report lm, echo=FALSE}
kin_report_lm <- kableExtra::kbl(kin_report, digits = 10)
kin_report_lm <- kableExtra::kable_classic_2(kin_report_lm, full_width=FALSE)
```

```{r show kinetic report lm}
kin_report_lm
```

To calculate Vmax and Km firstly I took the model coefficients:  

```{r linear model coefficients}
coef(model_lm)
```
From equation 2 the coefficients are $(Intercept) = 1/Vmax$ and $S_i = Km/Vmax$ (the slope of the line).  

Finally I also plotted the transformed data and represented the fitted model as a blue line. For this I used the `ggplot2` package.  

```{r linear model plot, eval=FALSE}
# 5 Plot for transformed data and linear model -------------------------------

# 5.1 Make the plot usin ggplot2
model_plot_lm <- ggplot(kinetic_data, aes(S_i, v_i)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) +
  xlab("1/[S] (1/M)") +
  ylab("1/v (min/M)") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(color = "black", size = 13),
    axis.text.y = element_text(color = "black", size = 13),
    axis.title = element_text(color = "black", size = 15)
  )

# 5.2 Save Plot
ggsave("graphs/kinetic_plot.jpeg", model_plot)
```
I saved this plot as "kinetic_plot.jpeg" in my graph folder.  

```{r show linear model plot}
model_plot_lm
```

### Nonlinear Regression Analysis

Instead of transforming the equation 1 into a linear form, we can obtain the constants in a straight way using the function `nls()`.  

```{r non linear model script, code=readLines("analysis/non_linear_regression.R"), message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

The steps I followed were similar than those in the linear model script. First, I checked and loaded the necessary packages, I imported the data and in the second step I fitted the non linear model:  

```{r fit non linear model, eval=FALSE}
# 2 Fitting non linear model -------------------------------------------------

# 2.1 Fit non linear model
model_nls <- nls(
  v ~ (Vmax * S)/(Km + S), 
  data = kinetic_data, 
  start = c(Vmax = 0.01, Km = 0)
)

# 2.2 Model summary
model_sum_nls <- summary(model_nls)

# 2.3 Save model summary
capture.output(file = "data/model_summary_nls.txt", model_sum_nls)
```

Note that I specified the model as the equation 1 (`v ~ (Vmax * S)/(Km + S)`). The function `nls()` also needs start values for both coefficients. You can see more information about this functions by typing `?nls`.  

I saved the results in my data folder as "model_summary_nls.txt". You can simply type `model_sum_nls` to see this summary:   

```{r nlm summary}
model_sum_nls
```

As you can see, this is straight way to obtain the Vmax and Km constants.  

On the third step I made a data frame with all the results and saved it as "kinetic_report_nls.csv" in my data folder:  

```{r}
# 3 Kinetic report ---------------------------------------------------------

# 3.1 Enzyme concentration (M)
enz <- 4.5e-8

# 3.2 Model coefficients
coeffs_nls <- unname(coef(model_nls))

# 3.3 Calculate kcat and kcat/km 
kcat <- coeffs_nls[1]/enz
kcat_km <- kcat / coeffs_nls[2]

# 3.4 Make a data frame with the results
kin_report_nls <- data.frame(
  Vmax = signif(coeffs_nls[1], 2), 
  Km = signif(coeffs_nls[2], 2),
  Enz = enz, 
  kcat = signif(kcat, 2), 
  kcat_km = signif(kcat_km, 2)
  )

# 3.5 Save kinetic report
write.csv(kin_report_nls, "data/kinetic_report_nls.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

This is the table with all the calculated constants:  

```{r kin report nls, echo=FALSE}
kin_report_nls_kbl <- kableExtra::kbl(kin_report_nls, digits = 10)
kin_report_nls_kbl <- kableExtra::kable_classic_2(kin_report_nls_kbl, full_width=FALSE)
```
```{r show kin report nls, echo=FALSE}
kin_report_nls_kbl
```

If you compare this table with the obtained in the linear regression section you will notice that there are not big differences. Later I will compare both methods taking into consideration their prediction performance.  

Finally I made a plot using the data and represented the non linear model as a blue line, note that this way allow us to represent a model completely related to the original data.  

```{r make nls plot, eval=FALSE}
# 4 Plot for transformed data and linear model -------------------------------

# 4.1 Make plot with ggplot2
model_plot_nls <- ggplot(kinetic_data, aes(S, v)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "nls", se = FALSE, formula = y ~ a*x/(b+x),
              method.args = list(start = c(a = 0.01, b = 0))) +
  xlab("[S] (M)") +
  ylab("v (M/min)") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(color = "black", size = 13),
    axis.text.y = element_text(color = "black", size = 13),
    axis.title = element_text(color = "black", size = 15)
  )

# 4.2 Save plot
ggsave("graphs/kinetic_plot_nls.jpeg", model_plot_nls)
```

In the function `geom_smooth()` I designated the `method`, the `formula` and the `method.args` arguments. This was similar to the code where I fitted the non linear model using the function `nls()`. 

```{r model plot nls}
model_plot_nls
```

I saved this plot in my graph folder as "kinetic_plot_nls.jpeg".  

### Comparing both Methods

First, we can simply compare the tables with the constant results.

Results from the linear regression approach:

```{r constants for linear model, echo=FALSE}
kin_report_lm
```

Results from the nonlinear regression approach:

```{r constants for non linear model, echo=FALSE}
kin_report_nls_kbl 
```

Yeah, there is no a big difference, but what would you think if I tell you that the real values for Vmax and Km are exactly those obtained in the nonlinear regression? I mean, I stated these values when I simulated the experimental data.  

Other way to compare the models is by determining how good they are to make predictions, namely, how far the reaction velocity predictions are from the experimental values?  

I made this evaluation with the next script:  

```{r comparison script, code=readLines("analysis/compare_models.R"), warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```

In both cases I fitted the model. In the linear model I had to transform the predictions to the original units with the code:  

```{r tranfor predictions linear model, eval=FALSE}
# 2.2 Predicted values for linear model
predicts_lm <- predict(model_lm) 
predicts_lm <- predicts_lm^-1
```

Remember, to fit the linear model I've used the equation 2, so firstly I transformed the substrate concentrations and the reaction velocity data. 

Next, I calculated the residuals (real value - predicted value), I squared these values, added them up, and divided by the degrees of freedom to obtain an average of these deviations.  

```{r linear model residuals, eval=FALSE}
# 2.3 Average sum of squared residuals
squared_res_lm <- (data$v - predicts_lm) ^ 2
sum_res_prom_lm <- sum(squared_res_lm) / (nrow(data)-length(coef(model_lm)))
```

The residual standard error or RMSE is the square root of the previous value, so we have a measurement of the average deviations in the original response units.  

```{r linear model rsme, eval=FALSE}
# 2.4 RSME for linear model
rsme_lm <- sqrt(sum_res_prom_lm)
```

I followed the same pattern for the nonlinear regression:  

```{r non linear model rsme, eval=FALSE}
# 3.1 Fit non linear model
model_nlm <- model_nls <- nls(
  v ~ (Vmax * S)/(Km + S), 
  data = kinetic_data, 
  start = c(Vmax = 0.01, Km = 0)
)

# 3.2 Predicted values for non linear model 
predicts_nlm <- predict(model_nlm)

# 3.3 Average sum of squared residuals
squared_res_nlm <- (data$v - predicts_nlm) ^ 2
sum_res_prom_nlm <- sum(squared_res_nlm) / (nrow(data)-length(coef(model_nlm)))

# 3.4 RSME for non linear model
rsme_nlm <- sqrt(sum_res_prom_nlm)
```

I must point out that you can see the residual standard error by looking at each model summary, but for more clarity I decided to show you the way you can calculate it, besides the residuals for the lineal fitting were not in the original velocity data units.  

To compare both RSME you can simply divide them:  

```{r rsme divition}
rsme_lm / rsme_nlm
```

So we can conclude that both models have a similar performance estimating reaction velocity values. Anyway, I think that the nonlinear regression is a better approach since offer a straight way to estimate Vmax and Km without any data transformation.
