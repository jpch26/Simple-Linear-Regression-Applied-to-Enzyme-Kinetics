R in the Lab: Simple Linear Regression Applied to Enzyme Kinetics
================

A R tutorial about how to perform a simple linear regression analysis
applied to an enzyme kinetics experiment. It also explore an alternative
approach by nonlinear regression.

Note that I did not explain how I simulated the experimental data, but
you can see the code on data\_simulation.R

If you have cloned this repository and want to run this analysis from
scratch first run erase\_all\_outputs.R script and then run Main.R
script o whichever script you want.

You can read the presentation for this tutorial by clicking on: [Simple Linear Regression Applied to Enzyme Kinetics](https://github.com/jpch26/Simple-Linear-Regression-Applied-to-Enzyme-Kinetics/blob/main/Simple%20Linear%20Regression%20Applied%20to%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md).
